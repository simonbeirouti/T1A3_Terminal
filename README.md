## Coding style

For the coding style, I am using the [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) formatter. It is built into Visual Studio via [this plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter). The benefits of this is it returns an error if you don't do what it likes.

## Installation steps

1. `git clone https://github.com/simonbeirouti/T1A3_Terminal.git`
2. `cd into T1A3_Terminal`
3. `pip3 install rich`
4. `chmod u+x run_first.sh`
5. `./run_first.sh`

## Features

#### Automation

Instead of running three files, I created a bash script that will run each one, one after another.

#### Usage of the rich command line pacakge

The focus around this was to use a python library that enables the developer to create a more exciting UX.

#### Working with files

I am wanting to work off generated files and also append further files with more information when it comes through.
